        <h2>HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Creates the structure of the webpage and is made up of elements that work together to provide content and basic framework.</li>
          <li>Elements types include text, images, header, lists, page divisions, meta related, and semantic.</li>
          <li>Attributes are inside open tags and also defined in beginning element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is the opening element and contains metadata. Metadata is data about the webpage that is not seen by the user. It contains information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The head element contains title bar and language setting.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body element has two different types of elements: Semantic and non-semantic.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements are perferred and important because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers, browser, and accessibility to a wide variety of users.</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements are a simple solution to lay out problems. Example: div to create a division in page or span to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>Headers elements are numbered 1-6, which refers to the level of the heading.</li>
          <li>The paragraph element wraps text and the letter p in arrows is used.</li>

        <h2>CCS: Cascading</h2>
        <Ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS style sheet: adds style an element directly in the HTML file. inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS style sheet are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>In Internal style sheets, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are preferreed and keeps CSS rules in separate file</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>

        <li>git add -A: add changed files into your working directory to the staging area of git</li>
        <li>git commit -m "comment": commits changes to your repo. -m flag refers to a message attached.</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: syncs local branch with the remote branch on Github </li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li> JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li> avaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li> Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li> Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Disqus or Facebook. Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
          <li> The .js file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file.</li>
          <li> A VARIABLE is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li> To declare a varible, you can use VAR keyword to create a variable. Currently, Java uses a new syntax and this should be avioded.</li>
          <li> The CONST keyword creates a variable that can't be reassigned a value. It locks down what that variable will be once we declare it. It cannot be reassigned once it is declared.</li>
          <li> Operator symbol "=" assigns specific data we want stored in our variable."
          <li> STRINGS are contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li> Each line of JaveScript code ends with a semi colon.</li>
          <li> Console method</li>
          <li> Argument: </li>
          <li> We can link the JaveScript by adding a LINK file into the HEAD element of the HTML.</li>
          <li> On windows:  Control+Shift+I opens DevTools.</li>
          <li> The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write.</li>
          <li> Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.  The order of code affects the outcome. </li>
          <li> Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all. </li>
          <li> One type of conditional statements is an IF statenebt. An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition is not true or has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li> ELSE IF: The computer will continue through all of the conditions that we list, evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy. Once it finds a condition that is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the if statement.</li>
          <li> if "===" in each condition. The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. </li>
          <li> An ARRAY is a group of related data in a variable and use a for loop to perform a task on each piece of the data, using just a few lines of code.</li>
          <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. </li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
